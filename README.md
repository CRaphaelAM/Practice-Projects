In this project I had to perform data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataset. 
This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, 
available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website and obtained from the
"Data Analysis with Python" course from IBM.

I used Linear Regression, Polynomial Features and Ridge Regression to make predictions based
on the data, and evaluated performance using r2_score metrics to select the right model.
